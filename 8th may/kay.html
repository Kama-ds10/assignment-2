      Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) is a major player ​in the global LNG business.
      NLNG was incorporated as a Limited Liability company on May 17, 1989, to
      harness Nigeria's vast natural gas resources and produce Liquefied Natural
      Gas (LNG) and Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) for ex​​port.

    <p>
      This scheme was instituted to complement Federal Government's effort in
      rebuilding Nigeria's North-Eastern region through the award of
      scholarships to 30 candidates (10 from each of the IDP camps in the three
      states worse hit by insurgency – Adamawa, Borno and Yobe).
